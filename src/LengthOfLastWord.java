        Length of Last Word
        Given a string s consisting of words and spaces, return the length of the last word in the string.
        A word is a maximal substring consisting of non-space characters only.

         Example 1:
        Input: s = "Hello World"
        Output: 5
        Explanation: The last word is "World" with length 5.

        Example 2:
        Input: s = "   fly me   to   the moon  "
        Output: 4
        Explanation: The last word is "moon" with length 4.

        Example 3:
        Input: s = "luffy is still joyboy"
        Output: 6
        Explanation: The last word is "joyboy" with length 6.

    /*
        Explanation:
        This approach starts by turning the string input into a String array using the .split() method and empty spaces as the delimiter that separates them. From there, it gets the index of the last word by subtracting 1 from the length of the array. It then uses the index to access the last word in the array and uses the .length() method to get the wordâ€™s length before returning it.
